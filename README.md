-Build Tool : Maven

## How to run test?

Notes: To run the scenario in Login.feature, use "@wip" tag in CukesRunner class/Cucumber Options

## WAY: 
-Clone the project
-Import Maven dependencies from pom.xml

** For UI \
-Go src --> test > java > com > sauce > runners > CukesRunner and Run button


 My framework is Cucumber (BDD). \
• I built my framework using Java Programming Language. \
• I used maven as a build automation tool for my java project. \
• I used Cucumber-Junit and Cucumber runner to orchestrate tests. \
• Inside the Cucumber runner, I used glues to connect feature files to step definitions. \
• I added the report plugin to Cucumber Runner to generate Json and HTML report. \
• I have a utilities package, which contains utility classes such as Configuration Reader. \
• I am using Page Object Modelling to enhance test maintenance and reducing code duplication. This is one of the most famous Selenium approaches. \
• I use Page Object Classes to store and identify the elements that I work on. \
• I use the PageFactory class and initElements method to initialize them. \
• I am using Cucumber and Gherkin language for non-technical people to understand what is going on in testing. \
• To interact with browsers, I am utilizing Selenium WebDriver. \
• I used the Singleton pattern by declaring constructor of class as private so that no one instantiates class outside of it.  \
And declared a static method with return type as object of class which should check if class is already instantiated once. \
• I used a Cucumber Scenario outline and example feature. \
• I have created my test cases in the feature files as-is. \
• In the Feature folder, I store my feature files separately, and it helps in the usability of the codes. \
• I use hook class as pre-and post-test implementations. \
• Step Definitions folder is the place where my actual test scripts are. \
• I added a screenshot interface; when the scenario fails, it takes a screenshot. \
• For assertions/verifications, to compare expected and actual results I utilize Junit assertions. \
• I also use tags for tests that I want to run in bulk. \
• My framework is easy to maintain since I have elements stored in one centralized place. \
If any changes happen on the application about the elements, I know where to go and how to fix it to run test scripts correctly.
